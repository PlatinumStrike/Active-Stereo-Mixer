# Active-Stereo-Mixer

This project was created to test my circuit design skills, as well as tackle a problem I had been having with my personal speaker setup.
I found myself having to manually plug and un-plug connection from my speaker whenever I needed to move from my projector, to a music player, to even my phone. To solve this, I decided to design a mixer to allow multiple sources to be connected and even play at the same time.

I created a schematic, bill of materials, laid out a PCB and generated Gerber files, and finally ordered and assembled the project.
