# Active Stereo Mixer

> Never mess with mulitple Amp sources again!

This project was created to tackle a very frustrating issue any passive speaker owner has to face, source management.
Instead of purchasing a very expensive reciever to solve this, I decided to create a simple mixing board to combine multiple audio sources at once.
